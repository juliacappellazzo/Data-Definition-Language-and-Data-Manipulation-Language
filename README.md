The project aims to enhance the relational data model of the SGV (Video Management System) for Melhores Compras LTDA. This includes applying DDL commands to improve database structure, enforce data integrity, and implement new constraints. Additionally, it involves using DML commands to populate the database with meaningful and consistent data, ensuring its usability. Lastly, DRL (SELECT) queries are used to generate insightful reports for business users, helping with decision-making. Deliverables include DDL, DML, and DRL scripts, along with documentation of execution results. The final output ensures a robust, well-structured database ready for operational and analytical purposes.
